Test that both llvm-dis (uses a data streamer) and opt (no data streamer)
handle a .bc file padded with '\n' at the end.

This files can be produced under a peculiar situation:

* A .bc is produced os OS X, but without a darwin triple, so it has no
  wrapper.
* It is included in a .a archive
* ranlib is ran on that archive. It will pad the members to make them multiple
  of 8 bytes.

RUN: llvm-dis -disable-output %p/Inputs/padding.bc
RUN: opt -disable-output %p/Inputs/padding.bc
