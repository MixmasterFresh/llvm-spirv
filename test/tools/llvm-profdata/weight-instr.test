Tests for weighted merge of instrumented profiles.

1- Merge the foo and bar profiles with unity weight and verify the combined output
RUN: llvm-profdata merge --instr %p/Inputs/weight-instr-bar.profdata:1 %p/Inputs/weight-instr-foo.profdata:1 -o %t
RUN: llvm-profdata show --instr -all-functions %t | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=WEIGHT1

2- Merge the foo and bar profiles with weight 3x and 5x respectively and verify the combined output
RUN: llvm-profdata merge --instr %p/Inputs/weight-instr-bar.profdata:3 %p/Inputs/weight-instr-foo.profdata:5 -o %t
RUN: llvm-profdata show --instr -all-functions %t | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=WEIGHT2

3- Bad merge: foo and bar profiles with invalid weights
RUN: not llvm-profdata merge --instr %p/Inputs/weight-instr-bar.profdata:3 %p/Inputs/weight-instr-foo.profdata:-5 -o %t.out 2>&1 | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=ERROR3
ERROR3: error: Input weight must be a positive integer.
