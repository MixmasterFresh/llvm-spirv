Tests for weighted merge of sample profiles.

1- Merge the foo and bar profiles with unity weight and verify the combined output
RUN: llvm-profdata merge --sample --text %p/Inputs/weight-sample-bar.proftext:1 %p/Inputs/weight-sample-foo.proftext:1 -o - | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=WEIGHT1
WEIGHT1: foo:1763288:35327
WEIGHT1:  7: 35327
WEIGHT1:  8: 35327
WEIGHT1:  9: 6930
WEIGHT1:  10: 29341
WEIGHT1:  11: 11906
WEIGHT1:  13: 18185 foo:19531
WEIGHT1:  15: 36458
WEIGHT1: bar:1772037:35370
WEIGHT1:  17: 35370
WEIGHT1:  18: 35370
WEIGHT1:  19: 7005
WEIGHT1:  20: 29407
WEIGHT1:  21: 12170
WEIGHT1:  23: 18150 bar:19829
WEIGHT1:  25: 36666

2- Merge the foo and bar profiles with weight 3x and 5x respectively and verify the combined output
RUN: llvm-profdata merge --sample --text %p/Inputs/weight-sample-bar.proftext:3 %p/Inputs/weight-sample-foo.proftext:5 -o - | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=WEIGHT2
WEIGHT2: foo:8816440:176635
WEIGHT2:  7: 176635
WEIGHT2:  8: 176635
WEIGHT2:  9: 34650
WEIGHT2:  10: 146705
WEIGHT2:  11: 59530
WEIGHT2:  13: 90925 foo:97655
WEIGHT2:  15: 182290
WEIGHT2: bar:5316111:106110
WEIGHT2:  17: 106110
WEIGHT2:  18: 106110
WEIGHT2:  19: 21015
WEIGHT2:  20: 88221
WEIGHT2:  21: 36510
WEIGHT2:  23: 54450 bar:59487
WEIGHT2:  25: 109998

3- Bad merge: foo and bar profiles with invalid weights
RUN: not llvm-profdata merge --sample --text %p/Inputs/weight-sample-bar.proftext:3 %p/Inputs/weight-sample-foo.proftext:-5 -o %t.out 2>&1 | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=ERROR3
ERROR3: error: Input weight must be a positive integer.
